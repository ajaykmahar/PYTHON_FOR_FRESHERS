Python Identifiers

What you should expect  from this video?
	Will understand what are Identifiers and keywords in python
What are the Rules for writing identifiers
Best practice, how to use them

An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc.
Example 
a = 10
b = 20

Rules for writing identifiers
can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _.
 identifier cannot start with a digit
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. 


We will cover best practice for writing python code like a pro,in upcomming videos, there are some set of pre define rules which every python programmers should follow. That is known as PEP8 rules. 
If you don’t know anything about pep8 don’t worry we will conver everything in this series of videos.
 
Python Keywords
Keywords are the reserved words in Python that is used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier.
keywords are case sensitive.
keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase 
The list of all the keywords 
help(‘keywords’)

Looking at all the keywords at once and trying to figure out what they mean might be overwhelming.

Things to Remember
Python is a case-sensitive language.(that applies to identifier and keywords both)
Always name identifiers that make sense.
Good idea to using an underscore for long vars, this_is_a_long_variable.
Keywords are reserved words
There are only 3 keywords which start with CAP letter.
There are two methods to see keywords from pytohn intractive shell..
